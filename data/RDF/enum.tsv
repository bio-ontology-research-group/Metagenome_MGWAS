freshwater lake biome	ENVO:01000252	A biome which is determined by a freshwater lake.
aquatic biome	ENVO:00002030	A biome which is determined by a water body and which has ecological climax communities adapted to life in or on water.
marine biome	ENVO:00000447	An aquatic biome which is determined by a marine water body.
tropical savanna biome	ENVO:01000188	A savanna biome which is subject to tropical climate patterns.
tropical shrubland biome	ENVO:01000214	A shrubland biome which is subject to tropical climate patterns
arid biome	ENVO:01001838	A biome which is subject to arid environmental conditions.
desert biome	ENVO:01000179	A desert biome is a terrestrial biome which loses more liquid water by evapotranspiration than is supplied by precipitation and includes communities adapted to these conditions.
tropical desert biome	ENVO:01000183	A tropical desert biome is a desert biome which has communities adapted to temperatures above a monthly average of 18 degrees Celsius, high daily temperature ranges of approximately 20 degrees Celsius, very high insolation due to inhibited cloud formation, and very low precipitation. Tropical desert biomes located near coasts with cold upwellings may have cooler temperatures and reduced insolution due to fog.
terretrial ecosystem	ENVO:01001790	
grassland ecosystem	ENVO:01001206	An ecosystem in which grasses (Graminae) are the dominant form of vegetation and determine the system's structure and dynamics.
marsh	ENVO:00000035	A wetland ecosystem which includes communities of grasses, rushes, reeds, typhas, sedges, and other herbaceous plants (possibly with low-growing woody plants)
freshwater marsh	ENVO:00000053	A marsh in which soils are saturated with water that contains low concentrations of salts
saline marsh	ENVO:00000054	A marsh whose water contains a considerable quantity of dissolved salts.

plant matter	ENVO:01001121	Organic material which is primarily composed of plant structures, living or dead.
clay	ENVO:00002982	Particulate environmental material which 1) is composed primarily of clay particles, with only minor proportions of other materials, 2) demonstrates plasticity when wet, and 3) is capable of hardening when dried or fired.

It is recommended to use a combination of sediment terms to describe a more specific sediment type.
soil	ENVO:00001998	An environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, interstitial gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms.
fecal material	ENVO:00002003	An excreta material which is composed primarily of feces, an excreta consisting of waste products expelled from an animal's digestive tract through the anus (or cloaca) during defecation.
